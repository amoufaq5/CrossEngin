# CLAUDE.md

Project state snapshot for AI assistants resuming work on this
codebase. Concise on purpose. Read top to bottom once, then keep
nearby.

## What this is

CrossEngin: AI-native multi-tenant platform. Three layers — a
kernel (multi-tenancy + meta-schema + DDL emit), declarative
manifests, and an AI Architect agent that authors them. ERP and
healthcare verticals ride on top.

## Where we are

Phase 1 contract-types layer: **33 packages, 76 meta-schema
tables, 3,563 tests**, all green, no type errors. Nearly the
full Phase 1 surface is sketched in zod schemas + deterministic
helpers. Impure runtime (network calls, file I/O, DB execution,
provider clients) is deferred to Phase 2+.

README has been refreshed to reflect this state. ADRs 0001-0038
are fully drafted in `docs/adr/` — no reserved gaps.

## Architecture in 90 seconds

- **`zod` schemas are the source of truth.** Types derive via
  `z.infer`. Every package exports `XSchema` + `type X` pairs.
- **Pure contracts + deterministic helpers only.** A package
  defines record shapes, state machines, and pure functions
  (validators, predicates, comparators). It does not open
  sockets, hit databases, or shell out.
- **Kernel meta-schema is the integration point.** Every package
  that needs persisted records wires `META_*` table definitions
  into `packages/kernel/src/bootstrap/meta-schema.ts`. The kernel
  emits DDL deterministically from those.
- **Tenant isolation by RLS.** Tenant-scoped tables enable PG
  row-level security with `tenant_id = current_setting(
  'app.current_tenant_id', true)::UUID`. Platform-wide tables
  skip RLS. Both are tested by the meta-schema test suite.
- **Strict TypeScript.** No `any`. No `--no-verify`. Use explicit
  return types for exported functions when inference is murky.

## Package map

Grouped by concern. Each is `packages/<name>` with `src/index.ts`
re-exporting everything.

### Substrate (the kernel itself)
- **`kernel`** — meta-schema (71 tables), DDL emit, manifest
  validate/diff/patch/topology/hash, bootstrap SQL generator.
- **`types`** — primitive zod types shared across the workspace
  (UUIDs, ISO 8601, slugs, etc.).
- **`config`** — shared TypeScript + lint config base.
- **`testing`** — `vitestPreset` re-export used by every package.

### Identity, security, data
- **`auth`** — RBAC + ABAC + field-level permissions + write
  masks. RoleDefinition, RbacGrant, principals.
- **`sso`** — federated identity: SAML 2.0 + OIDC providers,
  SCIM 2.0 provisioning, claim mappings + JIT policies, session
  lifecycle, login audit.
- **`security`** — data classification, encryption keys, CSP,
  backup policy, incident classification, threat model,
  certifications.
- **`compliance`** — compliance pack architecture (21 CFR 11,
  HIPAA, GDPR, UAE-MoH). Packs contribute clauses to manifests.
- **`residency`** — 8 regions (eu-central/west, us-east/west,
  me-uae, gcc-ksa, apac-sg, ap-south), broad regions,
  residency profiles, routing.
- **`files`** — file lifecycle (upload → scan → available →
  archived), storage tier transitions, OCR, quota, audit.

### AI surface
- **`ai-providers`** — provider router, pricing tables, fallback
  policy, latency budgets.
- **`ai-architect`** — AI Architect session contract, safety
  policy (refusals, gates, refusal copy, tenant settings, cost
  ceilings, eval gate, incidents, redteam).

### Runtime + operations
- **`jobs`** — Inngest-style job kinds, idempotency keys, dead
  letters, cost ledger.
- **`observability`** — SLO definitions, error budget compute,
  redaction, synthetics, OTel-style tracing.
- **`integrations`** — integration call audit, idempotency at the
  integration boundary, HMAC signatures, retry policy.

### Reporting / search / UI
- **`reporting`** — reports, dashboards, schedules, ClickHouse
  audit, CDC.
- **`search`** — Typesense-style manifest, query, permission tags,
  embeddings, reindex.
- **`views`** — frontend renderer types (columns, views, theme,
  i18n, permissions, widgets).
- **`i18n`** — locales, ICU MessageFormat, CLDR plurals, bundle,
  resolution, calendar, tenant config.

### Business operations
- **`billing`** — plans, subscriptions, metered usage, invoices,
  payments, dunning, tax, events.
- **`finops`** — 17 cost categories × 5 allocation methods,
  per-tenant attribution, budgets + breach actions, unit
  economics (LTV/CAC/contribution margin), chargeback
  statements, cost reports.
- **`tenant-lifecycle`** — 7-state lifecycle (trial → … →
  deleted), grace periods, GDPR Article 17 deletion requests,
  data exports, cryptographic tombstones.

### Delivery + operations infrastructure
- **`deploy`** — apps × environments × strategies; migrations;
  feature flags; releases; artifacts; on-prem/BYOC packaging.
- **`dr`** — 5 DR tiers (mission-critical → best-effort), RPO/
  RTO targets, replication topology, backups, failover
  records, drills, runbooks.
- **`edge`** — region routing, latency budgets per route,
  autoscaling policies, edge cache, throttling, region
  affinity.
- **`active-active`** — multi-region active-active topology, 7
  consistency levels, vector clocks, 6 CRDT kinds (G/PN counters,
  OR-set, LWW register/map, MV register), conflict detection +
  resolution, split-brain lifecycle.
- **`pwa`** — PWA manifest, service worker, IndexedDB outbox,
  sync, push notifications (PHI-safe stubs), Capacitor wrapper.

### Developer / partner surface
- **`sdk`** — public API contract (versioning, scopes, operations,
  RFC 9457 problem details, cursor pagination, idempotency,
  webhooks with HMAC-SHA256).
- **`sdk-clients`** — language-specific client generation
  contract (10 target languages × 10 registries × 3 tiers,
  generator pipeline, semver release lifecycle, compatibility
  matrix, auth + retry helpers, client telemetry with W3C
  trace context).
- **`marketplace`** — installable extension packs, pack registry
  with ed25519 signing + security review, per-tenant install
  lifecycle, permission grants, marketplace listings + reviews.
- **`migration`** — 12 source kinds (CSV, JSONL, Salesforce,
  ServiceNow, SQL dumps, FHIR, etc.), schema inference, field
  mapping, preview/dry-run, idempotent backfill ledger,
  onboarding flow (workspace_setup → … → go_live).
- **`ml-training`** — opt-in consent (phi/regulated permanently
  forbidden), training datasets, eval sets (safety_refusal
  requires 100% pass), training runs, evaluations, model
  registry with shadow/canary/production lifecycle.

### Audit + compliance operations
- **`incident-response`** — 5 SEV levels with SLA profiles, 7
  incident roles, 8-state incident lifecycle, runbook
  executions, blameless postmortems with action items,
  customer comms with GDPR 72h breach notification deadline.
- **`forensics`** — hash-chained tamper-evident logs, evidence
  with sealed/retention/destruction lifecycle, chain-of-custody
  with sha256-verified transfers, legal holds with separation of
  duties, e-discovery requests, court-admissible attestations.

## Cross-cutting invariants

Recurring patterns enforced by zod `superRefine`:

- **Four-eyes principle.** Anywhere an action is privileged
  (deletion, hold release, postmortem review, four-eyes
  approvals), the actor must not also be the approver. Check
  for `executedBy !== approvedBy`, `author ∉ reviewers`,
  `releasedBy !== issuedBy`.
- **State machines.** Most lifecycle types export a `*_STATUSES`
  enum, a `*_TRANSITIONS` map, and a `canTransition*` helper.
  The schema enforces status↔required-fields pairing.
- **Cryptographic anchoring.** Sha256 hashes for content
  addressing show up everywhere: dataset freezing, deletion
  proofs, evidence sealing, postmortem storage, webhook signing,
  pack signing (ed25519 there).
- **Tenant scoping.** Records with `tenant_id` get RLS. Cross-
  tenant audit/compliance records are platform-wide (cdc
  checkpoints, regions, plans, deployments, ediscovery,
  tombstones).
- **Forbidden lists.** PHI/regulated data can never be used for
  ML training (`FORBIDDEN_TRAINING_DATA_CLASSES`). Latest docker
  tag is forbidden (deploy). Two-person integrity for human
  evidence collection.
- **Deadlines.** Where regulation imposes timing (GDPR 72h
  breach, Article 12(3) 3-month deletion deadline), schemas
  enforce it.

## Meta-schema

`packages/kernel/src/bootstrap/meta-schema.ts` is the central
catalog of 76 platform-level Postgres tables. Each new package
adds tables there + updates `meta-schema.test.ts` (table count,
expected names list sorted alphabetically, column-check
assertions).

The test suite enforces two invariants:
1. Every `tenant_id`-bearing table has RLS enabled.
2. Foreign-key references resolve to a table declared earlier
   in `META_TABLES`.

When adding tables, **append them to the array at the bottom in
the order the package was built**, not alphabetically. The
expected-names test sorts independently.

## Build + test commands

```bash
# Install
pnpm install

# Per-package
pnpm --filter @crossengin/<name> build
pnpm --filter @crossengin/<name> test
pnpm --filter @crossengin/<name> typecheck

# Workspace
pnpm -r build
pnpm -r test
pnpm -r typecheck

# Build is fast; full workspace test ≈ 30s
```

There is **no top-level lint script**. ESLint config has not
been migrated to v9 flat config yet; ignore lint until asked.

## Conventions

- **Module structure.** Each package: `package.json`,
  `tsconfig.json` (extends `@crossengin/config/typescript/base`),
  `vitest.config.ts` (re-exports `vitestPreset`), `src/index.ts`
  (re-exports all source modules), 4–7 `src/*.ts` source modules,
  matching `src/*.test.ts` files.
- **Naming.** Constants `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, types `PascalCase`,
  schemas `<Name>Schema`. Stable id prefixes per kind:
  `INC-YYYY-NNNN` for incidents, `EV-` for evidence, `PM-` for
  postmortems, `LH-` for legal holds, etc.
- **Tests.** Each module gets its own `*.test.ts`. Tests cover
  constants, schema validation (accept + reject paths), helper
  functions, and state-machine transitions. Aim for 15–30 tests
  per module.
- **No comments.** The codebase generally doesn't have JSDoc or
  inline comments. Don't add them unless explaining a non-obvious
  invariant.

## Workflow

The user drives construction with `go [letter]` commands. After
each completed package, propose 6–8 next options labeled A–H and
recommend one. The user picks. Each landed package follows this
shape:

1. Read the relevant ADR (or design fresh against the
   conversation context if no ADR exists yet).
2. Scaffold `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` + `vitest.config.ts`.
3. Build 4–7 source modules with comprehensive zod schemas +
   deterministic helpers. No placeholders.
4. Build `src/index.ts` re-exporting everything.
5. Wire `META_*` tables into kernel meta-schema (+ test).
6. Write `*.test.ts` files alongside each source module.
7. Run `pnpm --filter @crossengin/<name> test` until green.
8. Run `pnpm -r test` to confirm no regression.
9. Run `pnpm -r typecheck`.
10. `git commit` with a detailed multi-paragraph message
    describing each module's enums + invariants + helpers.
11. `git push -u origin claude/crossengin-development-LXLNw`.

## Git

- Working branch: `claude/crossengin-development-LXLNw`.
- Never force-push. Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`).
- Don't create PRs unless the user asks.
- Repository scope is restricted to `amoufaq5/crossengin` and
  `amoufaq5/erp`.

## What's deferred to Phase 2+

The current packages model the *shape* of the platform. The
following are intentionally out of scope until contracts settle:

- Real provider clients (Stripe, Salesforce, ServiceNow,
  Anthropic). Today the packages have credential refs + record
  types only.
- Real database execution. `kernel/bootstrap` emits SQL strings;
  it doesn't connect to Postgres.
- Real cryptography. Signature fields are typed as strings; the
  actual HMAC/ed25519 computation is not in this codebase.
- Apps under `apps/`. The directory is empty; UI lives in `views`
  as type definitions only.

## ADRs

ADRs 0001-0037 exist as markdown in `docs/adr/`. Every shipped
package has a corresponding ADR; no reserved gaps. When you ship
a new package, write the matching ADR in the same session,
following `0000-template.md` and the style of the existing
0026-0037 batch.
